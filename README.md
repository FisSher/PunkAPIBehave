# PunkAPIBehave
Mini test using behave and punkapi (beer related for fun)

To get started you should have pipenv https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/
Once in the project folder you can go by pipenv shell and then pipenv install
This will download the modules for you.

I used behave for bdd test and requests to make api calls.
